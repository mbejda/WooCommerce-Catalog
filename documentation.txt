Thank you for downloading the WooCommerce extension My Catalog Products.

The catalog options are located in the WooCommerce -> Settings -> Catalog page. 
You can activate the catalog functionality by click on the 'enable catalog products' checkbox
You need to set the Call to action located in the Catalog Settings.

You can style the call to action by targeting the catalog-product css class. 
.catalog-product {}
